## About :rocket:

Project made during the series ['Vue do jeito ninja'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07-TvnH7XNo&list=PLcoYAcR89n-qq1vGRbaUiV6Q9puy0qigW) of the [Tiago Matos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXUWGUoYNwtRxaRPoB4KocA) channel. During classes I managed to learn VueJs, I had never studied. VueJs is very simple and fun. I also worked with tests using jest.
